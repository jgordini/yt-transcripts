## Today's Quest: Gothforth and Multiply

Today's quest is called **Gothforth and Multiply**. It's really simple; we just need to create a multiplication table. This task is the eighth problem from the 2013 EPPL Problem Solving Competition.

### The Obvious Solution

For once, we are going to go straight to the obvious solution. We can generate the indices from **1** to a certain target number. Then, we simply need to provide the outer product using that argument, both on the left and the right side—so, vertically and horizontally in our table. This gives us our solution.

```apl
⍝ Basic solution
∘.×⍨⍳
```

Let’s get rid of the argument and give it a name. Now we can apply it as you want, and it works even on zero!

### Exploring Alternative Solutions

Now, let's have some fun, as the problem is already solved! The first thing we’re going to do is try to solve this without using the outer product, which is the obvious solution.

#### Using the Definition of the Outer Product

The outer product pairs up every element from the list on the left with every element from the list on its right. We can actually utilize a property of multiplication that it distributes over multiple arguments. If we pair up every element from our list of numbers with the entire list of numbers, then that will be equivalent.

Let’s say we have the numbers here and then multiply using a rank. We want every element, which are scalars (rank 0), from the left paired with the entire vector (rank 1) on the right using `iota 7` as both left and right arguments, and that gives us our solution.

```apl
×⍤0 1⍨⍳
```

This approach uses the outer product in a hidden way because it’s the definition of the outer product for scalar operands!

#### Generating Indices as Vectors

Interestingly, if you give a vector argument to `iota`, it generates all the indices of an array with that shape. This holds true even for a scalar one-element vector as well. Since these are the indices, those are the corresponding numbers that need to be multiplied together in a multiplication table.

We can simply say that we multiply across these or reduce each of these pairs of numbers with multiplication, and that gives us our solution!

```apl
{×/¨⍳⍵ ⍵}
```

### Reshaping for Fun

Let’s start again with these numbers. This time, we reshape them into the shape of our multiplication table. This just gives us repetition. 

Now, what we see is that multiplication is just a series of additions. On the first row, we need our original numbers from **1** to **7**. On the second row, we want the numbers from **1** to **7** added with the numbers from **1** to **7** again. In the third row, we want it added again. This is simply cumulative addition going down.

We can easily write that as `+/\`. So this is class backslash bar, the cumulative vertical addition, and that gives us our multiplication table as well.

We can then write this as a function, wrap it in braces, replace the **7s** here with the argument, and that gives us our solution.

```apl
{+⍀⍵ ⍵⍴⍳⍵}
```

### Testing and Further Exploration

We can further observe that this is a function application of `iota` on the argument and this is duplication on the argument. Duplication could also be written as self-concatenation, and we could express this as `omega , omega`.

Now we can write this testedly as self-concatenation with `iota` on the right. Next, let’s eliminate `iota`. How can we do that? 

If you take **7** and use it to reshape **1**, we get **seven ones**. Now we can do the same cumulative addition on those; that gives us the equivalent of `iota`, and then we can proceed as before.

### Using Cumulative Additions

We can write this testedly using the cumulative vertical sum of the self-concatenation reshaping the cumulative sum of reshaping with the right argument of **1**.

We can now apply this and get our multiplication table. It may seem silly, but it’s a nice exercise that can give insights into the relationship between functions.

### Going Further: Implementing Functions without Operators

Let’s take it one step further: let’s get rid of all APL operators. Now we're only allowed to use functions. 

We will start by generating our numbers and then recycle these until we have enough to fill the entire multiplication table. This just repeats them over and over again.

```apl
{⍵ ⍵⍴(⍵/⍳⍵)×(⍵×⍵)⍴⍳⍵}
```

Next, we need to multiply them with the corresponding numbers. The first seven numbers here need to be multiplied by **1**, and the next seven need to be multiplied by **2**. If we start off with the numbers from **1** to **7** and replicate them by **7** each, we can then put these two things together, and those are the numbers in our multiplication table. 

The only thing we need to do now is reshape them into the right shape, and we've got a multiplication table!

### Finding Alternative Methods

There are also other fun ways we can do this. We can take the numbers, reshape them repeatedly, and transpose that. 

Now we have the corresponding vertical numbers like we had with the outer product, and the horizontal numbers as we had as the right argument for multiplication in the outer product. All we need to do now is multiply these two together.

```apl
{t×⍉t←⍵ ⍵⍴⍳⍵}
```

We can also say that we take this and multiply it with its transpose, and we've got a multiplication table! 

If we wanted to make this into a function, we could just wrap it again, or we could give it a name.

### Relying on APL's Scalar Extension

Though there are even simpler ways of doing this by relying on APL's scalar extension. You can always scale or extend by using a scalar function together with an enclosure.

Let's explore how this can work. We have our numbers from **1** to **7**, and then we can enclose that, which makes it a scalar. If we pair up these two, the scalar **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7** gets paired with **1**, paired with **2**, paired with **3**, and so forth.

So we can simply write:

```apl
iota 7 * (⊂ iota 7)
```

And that gives us the rows of our matrix. The only thing that’s missing is mixing the rows into a proper matrix.

We can write this tacitly by simply removing the arguments.

### Final Challenge: Multiplication without Arithmetic

Finally, for the ultimate challenge, let’s implement the multiplication table without any arithmetic at all. 

Though this might seem impossible, we can implement multiplication in the old-fashioned counting stick way. Here is an example: let’s make it smaller so we can see what we're doing.

We know that `iota` can generate the numbers we need to get multiplied together by using two of the same argument. But how do we actually multiply them?

What we can do is that each of these pairs themselves can be an argument for `iota`. This gives us the indices of an array of those dimensions. 

```apl
{≢¨,¨⍳¨⍳⍵ ⍵}
```

However, that implies actual multiplication—if we have **three** and **two**, it gives us an array that has **three** rows and **two** columns, which has **six** elements, since it’s the number of rows times the number of columns.

Now, we just need to know how many elements there are in each one. Raveling them and counting the number of elements gives us our multiplication table, implemented without arithmetic!

### Conclusion

As explored, there are many ways to implement the multiplication table in APL, some traditional using operators, others involving clever functional approaches, and even some without any arithmetic whatsoever. 

While the simplest solution remains the outer product with normal multiplication, the exploration of alternatives offers valuable insights into APL’s functionality and capabilities.

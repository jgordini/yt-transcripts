hi we given two specifications of
time and we're going to find the
difference the absolute difference um
between
them the twist to this is that the
specifications of time are not
necessarily consistent uh they may might
include just minutes or they could be
hours and minutes or they could be days
and hours or
minutes so we have to normalize that and
then figure out how many minutes we've
got so the example we given is uh 213 on
one hand and uh 515 so this is 2 hours
and 30 minutes and 5 hours and 15
minutes and we want to find the
difference between them the only problem
is that we need to figure out first how
how many minutes are each one of them so
before we do the difference and
let's just concatenate together so we
can see we pre-processing both arguments
with a little pre-processing
function um and that's going to be
referring to the argument as
Omega and then we need to make sure that
we've got three elements so we padding
we need to pad with zeros on the left so
we get the um the dat days hours and
minutes and we can do that by taking a
-3 take so this takes the last three
elements padding with zeros on the left
so and now we're concatenating them
together that doesn't make so much sense
of course but we can see that we added a
single zero on the
left and now we need to convert to
minutes and conveniently we have a an
ability in APL to evaluate mixed radex
number systems
so we specify the base that's why we
have this base symbol and we specify a
base where there are 60 Minutes to the
hour 24 minutes uh uh 24 hours to a day
and no higher unit than
that so this m zero indicates that
there's no overflow to any higher unit
we just stay uh with days counting up
forever so this gives us the number of
minutes and we can now replace the
concatenation with a
subtraction we can see that the result
is negative so we need to take the
absolute
value it's this one um and apply that on
the
result that gives us our solution thank

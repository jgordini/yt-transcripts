welcome to the appeal Quest cap Wiki for
details
today's Quest is the sixth from the 2016
round of the APL problem solving
competition
we are to take a list of arrays specific
the list of vectors or possibly scalers
and sort them by that length the
shortest ones are in the front and the
longest ones at the end
this is really simple
let's make some test data
okay so this is a list or vector as we
call it and it has six elements let's
try printing it
and we can see that there are some
numbers that would have the length of
one and then there are some strings in
here that have the length of two and
five three and five and then there is
also a list of numbers which has length
four
and the way we get the length is by
using the tele function
and it looks kind of like a Telemark you
would make into a counting stick
but we don't want to tally D because
that will give us the number of elements
in D instead we want to tally each
element in D so we use the each operator
or higher order function which is kind
of like a map
so we are taking this function which
we're applying
to each element of d
and here we can see the length
what the number one has length one the
word two has links three and so on
and now we can use this to grade
grading is a it's a very apla operation
really but it's kind of like the more
fundamental form of sorting it doesn't
actually reorder the elements but rather
it gives us the indices of elements
as we would need to take them so that
they should become ordered we're not
doing the ordering quite yet and this
function exists like this because then
you can use that information to sort
something else which allows you
basically to sort some data by some keys
for example
so this gives us
that if we want it to be sorted by this
information the length of each
then we first take element number five
that's this empty string
and then element number one which is a
number and then element number four
which is this number four then element
number two because it has links three
and then element number six because it
has length four and finally
element number three because it has
things five
and then we can use this information to
index into d
so with square bracket indexing
which allows us multiple indices and
when we give it multiple integers it
just reorders the elements or picks out
those elements in that order
that gives us this
and that's the result that we want but
this isn't actually a function that does
the work rather it's just an expression
we can change this into a function
Anonymous function the Lambda and by
putting braces around it and then
denoting the argument with Omega because
the argument goes on the right just like
all the other functions we applied so
far
and the argument goes on the right and
Omega is the rightmost character of the
Greek alphabet so we put Omega instead
of the D's and this gives us a function
we can either apply it directly
or we can give it a name so this is uh
sort by length for example we use left
arrow for assignment equal sign just
means equality
so now we've given the name and we can
then call it on D
and it's Source it correctly for us and
that's really all there is to it thank
you for watching

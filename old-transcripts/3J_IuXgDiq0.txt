hi we are to find a reduced fraction for
a given
number so let's use an example of
1.2 I'll start with the actual full
solution because it's really short um
and then I'll explain how it does the
trick right so here is one .2 is
65 and the way this works is that we
have this is called a fork and where
this binds a left argument to the
Fort so the fork itself it
says and it looks like n symbol but n is
extended to be the lowest common
multiple so it's the low lowest common
multiple divided by the concatenation
what does it mean to take one function
divided by another one well we can
expand this to an explicit def instead
we have a left argument which has been
bound and that's called Alpha we have a
right argument which is called
Omega so here we
take the arguments and use them for both
these outer functions so this is the
lowest common multiple of the left
argument and the right
divided by the concatination of left
argument and the right
argument why does this compute the
reduced
fraction well what does it even mean to
have the lowest common
multiple this isn't the whole number
it's not usually how we think of lowest
common multiple but let's substitute in
this bound argument into the function as
a literal
now what does it mean here the lowest
common multiple of
1.2 that is also divisible by
one so we have to if it's divisible one
that means it has to be a whole number
if it's a whole number um then it can be
part of our fraction so let's try 1.2 *
1 1.2 * 2 2.4
3.6
4.8 and finally
Five Point well they become
six so if we multiply it with five then
we get six so the lowest common multiple
of one and 1.2 is
six so over here we get a number
six and here we concatenate the right
argument 1.2 with one so we have six
divided by one and by 1.2 now six
divided by one of course that's six that
gives us our left argument and and 6
ided by 1.2 why are we doing that
because we want to find out
um the
the other Factor we could say it's a
division we have six divided by
something is supposed to give one 1.2 so
that something we can find by dividing 6
by 1.2 because 1.2 times that other
thing will uh will give
six so this really becomes 6 divided
1 and 6 divided by the
argument and 6id one of course is six
and then we have 6 divided by uh the
argument and this is how uh the function
works
thank you for

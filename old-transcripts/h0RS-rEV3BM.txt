hi here we are to find the difference in
area
[Music]
between a square that's inscribed inside
a
circle and the Outer Circle so it's
actually the Outer Circle area minus the
inner squares uh
area and there's not much to figure out
here with regards to algorithm these are
known formulas so this video is going to
be a little bit different than usual in
that it's mainly going to be a symbolic
reasoning in tacd
APL so first a little bit of um Theory
we going to find out what are the areas
of these two components the circle and
the square and what the the input that
we're given is the diameter of the Outer
Circle so if that's the diameter of the
Outer Circle and the square inside is as
big as possible that means the square
inside is exactly touching with its
corners on the
circle also means that the diameter of
the circle is the diagonal in the Square
it's a straight line that goes from one
corner to the opposing corner
diagonally okay so with that in
mind we have the Pythagorean theorem
that states that the square of the
length of the longest side in a right
angle triangle is equal to the sum of
the squares of the shorter
sides however here we know it's a square
so the two shorter sides are identical
in length
now we're going to do this entirely
symbolically so let's do this with a
comment we're going to say
that the
square which is the same thing as the
multiplication of self so multiply by
itself um of
the
diameter of the circle which is the
diagonal in the Square
is equal
to the sum of the squares of the smaller
sides but since they're the same it's
then it is also the same as twice that
so if we take the squares of the smaller
sides and multiply that by the constant
two so this is a two that's made into a
constant function and and we're
multiplying that with the self
multiplication which is the square then
the equality
holds now we don't actually want to
compute it this direction we want to go
uh the other direction we want to to
find the um the smaller
sides such that we
can compute the area which is just the
small sides multiply by each other oh
but since they are identical then the
same thing as the square of the smaller
side and that's in fact what we're
getting here so in order to make this
work remember on the left we had the the
term that represents the diameter or
diagonal and on the right is we have the
squares for the smaller
sides all we need to do then is
eliminate this doubling on the
right so we can do that by dividing by
two on both sides that eliminates this
one and instead we divide by two
constant on the
left this equal sign is not to be taken
as a function here we just stating that
these two things are equivalent the
diameter diagonal and of the circle
square divided by the constant two is
and so the square of that diameter
divided by the constant two gives us the
square of the smaller sides the square
of the smaller sides that is the area
that we want so this formula is what we
need to apply to the original argument
in order to get the area of the
square okay now we need to get the area
of the circle here we don't use PR
Pythagoras we use Archimedes and
Archimedes says that the given the
diameter of um a circle the area of that
circle is going to be pi
times the
square so the self multiplication again
divided by four it could also be stated
simpler in terms of the radius but given
that we have given the diameter this is
what we
get right then the next step is going to
be
to combine these two areas we want the
area of the
circle
minus the area of the
square and now we want to combine these
two
things and we can observe a pattern here
but it's not exactly the same because
we've got here the square of the
argument divided by the constant four
and the square divided by the constant
two if we change this two into a four
then we have made it half as big as it
needs to be but we can compensate by
that by doubling it and while we could
write two times this we can also observe
the doubling just like squaring is the
self mul ation doubling is the self
addition right now we have these two
parts that are exactly the same so we
have for whatever this gives the squares
divided by four we have pi times that
minus the doubling of that so we can
break
out this part of the expression outside
a
parenthesis
let take that part and we put it here
and then we apply pi times
that minus twice
that and that gives us um our for our
finished formula which is very elegant
we can try
it and then we get the expected results
so very elegant formulation and an
example of reasoning entirely in tested
APL thank you for watching
